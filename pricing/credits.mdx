## Credit Rollover and Renewal

### Monthly Renewal

Credits are replenished at the beginning of each billing period based on your subscription plan:

- Credits are automatically added to your account
- Unused credits from previous months do not roll over
- Your credit balance is reset to your plan's allocation upon renewal

### Plan Changes

When changing plans, your credits are adjusted accordingly:

- **Upgrading**: Receive a prorated amount of additional credits immediately
- **Downgrading**: Your credit balance will be adjusted at the start of your next billing cycle
