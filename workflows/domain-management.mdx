## Best Practices

### Domain Selection

When choosing a domain name:

- **Keep it short** and memorable
- **Avoid numbers and hyphens** if possible
- **Consider multiple TLDs** for brand protection
- **Think about keywords** relevant to your business
- **Check for trademark issues** before purchasing

### DNS Management

For optimal domain configuration:

- **Document all DNS changes** you make
- **Set reasonably low TTL values** during initial setup (300-900 seconds)
- **Increase TTL values** after configuration is stable (3600+ seconds)
- **Create both www and non-www versions** of your domain
- **Set up proper redirects** between www and non-www
- **Configure SPF and DKIM records** if using email

### Security Considerations

To protect your domain:

- **Enable domain privacy** to hide personal information
- **Use strong passwords** on your registrar account
- **Enable two-factor authentication** where available
- **Lock your domain** to prevent unauthorized transfers
- **Keep contact information current** for important notifications
- **Set up auto-renewal** to prevent accidental expiration
